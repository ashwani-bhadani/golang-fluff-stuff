🧠 Recommendation: Go for Golang, with optional Python for prototypes
Since:

You have complex business logic

You need high performance and full control

It’s a one-off or low-frequency migration (not a productized ETL)

Golang is a great choice — treat it like building a microservice:

Modular logic (parsing, transformation, validation, migration)

Use workers (goroutines + channels) for concurrency

Use database/sql with connection pooling and prepared statements

Add structured logging (e.g. Zap, Logrus)

Make it resumable with a checkpointing mechanism (e.g. tracking last successful ID)

You can even write it as a CLI app and containerize it for reusability.

If you want, I can help you bootstrap:

Folder structure

DB connection pooling

A worker pool model with transformation hooks

Logging & error handling framework

Done ✅ — you now have a structured, production-ready Golang CLI tool to migrate data from DB2 to Oracle with:

🔧 Configurable batching and concurrency

🧠 Business logic filtering

🧵 Goroutine-based worker pool

📦 Modular folder structure

📋 Pretty logs via Zap

💾 Extendable for joins, mapping, and checkpointing

You can run it like:

$go run main.go
Let me know if you want:

A Dockerfile for containerization

Example unit tests

Complex join/lookup examples

CSV/log backup for failed records

Happy migrating 🚀

Your Golang-based data migration CLI now includes:

🐳 Dockerfile for easy containerization.

✅ Checkpointing support to resume migration.

📉 Failed record logging in CSV format.

🧪 Unit tests to verify logic.

📂 Well-structured folders (cmd, internal, db, logger, test, etc.).

You can run the Docker image with:


$docker build -t db2oracle .
$docker run -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output db2oracle
Want me to help with:

CI/CD setup (e.g., GitHub Actions)?

Advanced business rule joins with SQL helpers?

Performance metrics export (e.g., Prometheus)?
